The [vpaste] and [mkinit] repositories have been converted from subversion to
to git. Previously, they were both contained in a single 'misc' repository but

[vpaste]: /tools/vpaste
[mkinit]: /tools/mkinit

In addition, vpaste now has support for embedding pastes in external web pages
and should run a little faster due to caching rendered pages.
