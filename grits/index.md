Grits
=====
Grits is a Virtual Globe library developed along side AWeather, but designed to
be usable by other program as well. It is differentiated from other Virtual
Globes such as Google Earth, NASA World Wind, and KDE Marble in that it is
developed primarily as a library that is used by other programs, such as
AWeather, rather than providing it's own user interface.
